      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I am Manikandan, an aspiring Full Stack MERN Developer with a
        B.Com in Information Technology from The American College, Madurai,
        graduating in 2025 with a CGPA of 7.0. My journey into web development
        began during my college years, where I discovered a passion for building
        interactive and efficient web applications. The MERN stack—MongoDB,
        Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—quickly became my area of focus,
        allowing me to develop both front-end and back-end solutions. I am
        dedicated to continuous learning, regularly working on projects to
        enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest technologies. My goal
        is to contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with talented
        teams, and grow as a developer in the ever-evolving tech industry.
